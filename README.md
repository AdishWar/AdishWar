I like experimenting with code and computers. I'm a curious and voracious learner and have explored domains like game development in Unity (including some AR/VR), procedural generation and visualisation in processing.js, Data Science and ML with Python, web dev with React, and mobile dev with Flutter.

One of my best project is a React + Flask webapp that records your voice and recongnizes its emotion using ML, and a Flutter app for airline customers to track and redeem their airline flight rewards.
